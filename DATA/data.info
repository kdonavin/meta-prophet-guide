DATA/CYCLING_AUCK_DATA/
- Description: Auckland cycling counts and matching weather regressors used for modeling the impact of weather on cyclist counts. Contains two subfolders:
  - CYCLING_COUNTS/: multiple CSVs with counts by year and aggregated counts (e.g., cycling_counts_2010.csv, cycling_counts_by_day.csv).
  - WEATHER/: weather-derived regressors split by time-of-day or aggregation (e.g., temp_day.csv, rain_commute.csv, sun_morning.csv, wind_day.csv).
- Source: Auckland Cycling dataset and examples repo. https://github.com/nicolasfauchereau/Auckland_Cycling

Notes and usage
- Files that originate from outside this repo include explicit source URLs where available (Airline Passengers, Peyton Manning, R Wikipedia examples, Auckland Cycling, Melbourne pedestrian portal link). Other files were curated or generated locally and lack upstream citations; if you know the original source for any of those, please update this file.
- To use these in Prophet examples: most CSVs follow the `ds`/`y` convention (date, value). Multivariate CSVs include additional columns that can be used as regressors.
